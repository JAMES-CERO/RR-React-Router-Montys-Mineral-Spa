Activity: React Router: Monty's Mineral SPA
Monty's Mineral SPA, a wellness brand and resort, has reached out for your help on its web app. The CEO, Monty McMansions, watched some videos on how to create a simple React app, but he's struggling to add multiple responsive pages to display his brand and to pass data into his components.

Monty has a fear of single-page applications (SPAs), but as a developer who recently learned React Router DOM, you have the opportunity to convince Monty to implement this library and create a responsive, dynamic SPA with multiple routes.
